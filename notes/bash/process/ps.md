# `ps`

Process status. Linux is multitasking and multi-user, allowing multiple processes to operate simultaneously without interfering with each other. `ps` manages these processes.

## Example

```sh
ps -f
```

Displays uid, pid, parent pid, recent CPU usage, process start time, controlling tty, elapsed CPU usage, and associated command.
