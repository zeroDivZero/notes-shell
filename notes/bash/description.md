# DESCRIPTION

Bourne-Again Shell. Written by Brian Fox for GNU Project as free software replacement of Bourne Shell (**sh**). First released in 1989.

Default login shell for most Linux distros, and macOS Mojave and earlier (but only up to version 3.2, which was released under GPLv2, as Apple wanted to avoid more restrictive GPLv3).
