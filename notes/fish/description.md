# DESCRIPTION

Friendly Interactive Shell. First released in 2005. Syntax derived from neither Bourne shell (bash, ksh, zsh) nor C shell (csh, tcsh). Unlike previous shells that disable certain features by default to save system resources, fish enables all features by default.

"Search as you type" automatic suggestions based on history and current directory. Like bash's Ctrl+R history search, but always on. Real-time feedback while typing, can select suggestions with arrow keys, or use tab completion. Tab-completion can expand file paths (with wildcards and brace expansion), variables, and many command specific completions. Command-specific completions, including options with descriptions, can to some extent be generated from commands' manpages.

Few syntactic rules, preferring features as commands rather than syntax. Makes features more discoverable. Functions can carry human readable description. Help command gives access to all fish documentation in web browser.
